Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'Bcash' with 'Bitcoin Cash'

This is a fork of [PanicSteve's Cloud-to-Butt
plugin](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt) which aims to disarm
trolling and intentional brand confusion in the Bitcoin and larger crypto realm
by universally replacing any instance of the incorrect name "Bcash" with the
proper name "Bitcoin Cash".

This browser plugin is installed in exactly the same fashion as Cloud-to-Butt.
