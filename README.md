Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'Bcash' with 'Bitcoin Cash'

[Direct download of crx file](https://github.com/kevinmershon/its-bitcoin-cash/blob/master/ItsBitcoinCash.crx?raw=true) (drag-drop into Chrome "Extensions" tab to install).

This is a fork of [PanicSteve's Cloud-to-Butt
plugin](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt) which aims to disarm
trolling and intentional brand confusion in the Bitcoin and larger crypto realm
by universally replacing any instance of the incorrect name "Bcash" with the
proper name "Bitcoin Cash".

This browser plugin is installed and works in exactly the same fashion as Cloud-to-Butt.
